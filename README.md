## Installation

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["openducky"]
}
```

## Usage

Just ask to be quizzed on any file:

```
ducky
```

```
Quiz me on src/index.ts
```

```
Use ducky to test my understanding of the auth module
```

OpenCode will prompt you to select a file and quiz mode, then begin the interactive quiz.

## Quiz Flow

1. **Select a file** - Choose which file you want to be quizzed on
2. **Choose a mode** - Skim (high-level) or Full (implementation details)
3. **Answer questions** - 3-5 questions presented one at a time
4. **Get feedback** - Each answer is evaluated with corrections if needed
5. **Review summary** - Final assessment of your understanding

## Modes

| Mode | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Skim** | Purpose, architecture, exports, interfaces, what the code does overall |
| **Full** | Logic flow, edge cases, error handling, why specific decisions were made |

## Topic Focus (Optional)

Narrow the quiz to a specific aspect:

```
Quiz me on src/api.ts, focus on error handling
```

```
Test my understanding of the caching logic in utils.ts
```
